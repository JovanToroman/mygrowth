        <h1>We Grow by Educating Ourselves</h1>
        <p>On their long journey in search of better life, migrants from war-plagued countries go through many challenges. One of them is finding a way to educate themselves while on the go, and having their achievements internationally recognized. We provide a platform to do just that.</p>

            <h1>MyGrowth - Innovating the Way in Which Migrants Get Their Education</h1>
            <p>There are 22,5 million refugees in the world. 
                51% of them are children below the age of 18.<br>
                Many of them attended primary school, but many less fortunate ones did not have access to education.<br>
                Now, when they are far away from the terrors of war, they have an opportunity for a fresh start.<br>
                MyGrowth is a Serbian startup, where young, motivated people strive to provide a unified platform, where all progress in migrants' education will be tracked.<br>
                Students will be able to review their progress through a simple web interface, by entering their unique student code.<br>
                Authorized teachers from each country participating in the program will have access to students progress assessment, which will be provided by his former teachers.</p>
